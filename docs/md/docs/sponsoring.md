# Sponsoring Projects

One of the other fantastic features GitHub provides is the ability for you to sponsor your favourite developers and open source projects 💝

It's super easy with GitHub. Simple visit a project you want to sponsor, and click on the `sponsor` button in the top right corner

You will be greeted by a page such as the one below. Select your contribution and connect your card/paypal

# Once you start sponsoring projects, you can optionally display is on your profile too. You will be recognised as a 'Github sponsor'
