# Fork And Pull Flow. The easiest way to contribute to open source on GitHub

One of the greatest ways to git gud, build your profile and demonstrate to potential job opportunities that you know your stuff and actively work on projects is to work on some open source projects.

The greatest thing about GitHub, is that its relatively easy to begin contributing once you master the *Fork and Pull* pattern!

# Okay, so what does this fork and pull pattern look like though?

# Right, now I am even more confused ðŸ˜…

Okay, so lets walk through a demonstration. In fact, the greatest thing about fork and pull is that you can practise 99% of it on your own repository!

There is no need to look for an open source project to contribute to to get started with the basics of pulling. Forking a project is essentially like creating a branch anyways, like we saw previously on our branching slide.

# How to Fork and Pull

- Start by locating a project you wish to contribute to
    - Fork that project. This can be done easily by using the `Fork` button in the top right corner (Afterward you will see it in your GitHub profile)
    - Clone that forked project to your local machine
    - Make the desired changes to the project, whichever way works for you.
    - Submit a PR to the original repository for the developer to review
    - If all goes well, it will be merged, then you can delete your forked repo. All done!
