# Merging your Git Branches

With GitHub merging is made easy!

## You can of course merge with your CLI using the below snippet

``` bash
git checkout <branchname>
git merge master
# finally push your local changes to the remote repo
git push
```

Or even in one line like so..

`git merge <branchname> master`


## However, using GitHub we can interactively merge a branch. It's personally my favourite way to merge branches.

To get started, create a branch and push it to your remote repository (stored on GitHub)

###  You will then see it listed under 'Branches' in the GitHub page for your repo

### Even better, GitHub will auto-display your recently pushed branches and ask you to PR them!

### From there we can create a **PR** known as "Pull Request" (More about that later!)
