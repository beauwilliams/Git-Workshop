# Rebasing with Git

As an alternative to merging, git offers another way to (for lack of a better word ðŸ˜†) merge your branches

Except this is like a special kind of merge. Unlike the previous slide. Where we end up with a *merge commit*

With rebasing, we finish off with a single trunk. This type of workflow is often called "Trunk based development"

# But why might we want to use rebase instead of merging?

- A cleaner commit history
- a cleaner project history

# Sounds good! Then why might we want to use merging?

- It's verbose
- What is the point of a VCS if you delete commits?
- Computers can handle plenty of information, ready for when you need it. Why delete commits?
- Rebasing can potentially destroy or significantly screw up your project if you are not careful
- You miss out on merge commit history, which might come in handy later on
- Unless you have a reason to be rebasing, it's of trivial benefit to your project

# Okay but I really want to use rebase..

**Do it interactively then! This can save you a lot of hassle down the track**

``` bash
git rebase -i master
```
