# A little bit of backstory..

Git was born of neccesity, as a tool to enable open source developers collaborate remotely.

The brainchild of Linus Torvalds, Git was created to assist with the development of the linux kernel in 2005.

Today Git is the by far the most popular distributed versioning system software. In 2010, only a mere 11.3% of repositories available as open source and online were using Git. However, it grew quickly since that year, as of 2020 70% of repositories are Git based as compared to 30% being Apache SVN.
