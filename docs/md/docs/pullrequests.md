# Creating your first Pull Request

Okay, so we walked through the fork and pull pattern. I feel comfortable with branches and merging now. There is this project I saw and I think there is something I can do to improve it. What do?

# Getting started

Once you know the basics of forking, branching and cloning, committing and pushing you are ready to start working on real world open source projects!

# Fork the project to your profile

# Make the changes to the project

# Submit the PR to the original project easily using GitHubs handy PR suggestion button

# So.. the recommended way to submit a basic PR, is to firstly, *fork the project* you wish to work on then:

- Clone it to your local machine
- Create a branch, i.e `feature` or `bug`
- Make the changes, commit them, push them to your new remote branch
- Submit the PR on GitHub visually (NOTE: You can do this via the `gh` CLI tool)
- Wait for it to be merged ðŸš€
- Congrats you are now contributing to open source!
