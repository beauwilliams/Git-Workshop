# Seeing the differences between your commits

Git provides a built in diffing feature. It's really handy when trying to debug your project when some erroneous code was introduced by mistake!

# Changes to tracked files
```bash
git diff
```

# Changes between commits

``` bash
git diff <ID1><ID2>
```
